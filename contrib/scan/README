This folder contains Python wrappers for various audio file scan tools.

A scan tool should be a Python script with a single function, scan(file), which
calls the correct tool and returns a dict of file information.

In addition the tools should have a "command-line" mode, where they can be
launched from CLI with one parameter (file path), call scan and pprint the
result.

watermelon needs a scan tool defined in core settings to parse uploaded files
and get important info from them.
